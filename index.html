<!--

This is a nice improvement over last week's version. Good to see you have some more control over your content and are still able to keep that 'tabbed' effect you were looking for

Now that you've got your layout here, start thinking about what real content you'll want to include. As you start putting that in there, you'll be able to style for your site's content rather than placeholders

With the way you've set this up, I think it would be cool to explore using solely the left sidebar as your navigation rather than both (as you alluded to in your notes). I find this to be an interesting treatment, and one not so often done. The way you are handling the tabs on mobile works nicely as well, and with some styles (perhaps a fixed position), they could be really slick
